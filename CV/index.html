    <h3>Story:</h3>
        <p>My life starts with the fact that I currently work in help desk, in my persuit or finding my self I've fallen in love with programming.
            The reason I decided to go into that was for the fact that I was getting married and as someone who wasn't finished school yet, needed some sort of income.
            As it stands right now I'm learning how to become a <em>Web Developer</em> and I'm having a blast so far :), lets brew some coffee and get started!
